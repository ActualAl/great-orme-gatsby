    Our cottage is situated on the Great Orme, Llandudno. The views are simply
    stunning: overlooking Conwy bay along the coast to Anglesey. It is situated
    on a quiet, child friendly road, with easy access to the pathways that go
    round the entire peninsula. There are plenty of activities nearby for all:
    the historic pier, cable cars, golf courses, restaurants & beaches. Slightly
    further afield you’ll find yourself in an excellent location to explore:
    historic Conwy, Snowdonia and Anglesey
description: Enjoy a great holiday in Llandudno, the Victorian seaside gem with a wealth of activities for all the family to enjoy.
             The cottage enjoys the best of both worlds; being a short walk from town, situated on the Great Orme, with breathtaking scenery.
             The fully equipped cottage is both cosy and stylish and is perfect for getting away from all.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
