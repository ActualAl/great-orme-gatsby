### About Jacinta and Alex
We're married with two children and are based in Liverpool. We bought the cottage in 2017 and love staying up there. We originally let the cottage through AirBnB, and we have "Super Host" status. More recently we've decided to rent it out ourselves, to friends and family, via word of mouth.

### Testimonials

__Gemma March 2020__

> _"Really enjoyed our stay at Alex And Jacintaâ€™s home. Amazing views and thoughtful touches. Thank you so much!"_

__Stella March 2020__

> _"We had a wonderful four days at the cottage. The view from the main bedroom is absolutely stunning. Great walks are on the doorstep and Llandudno centre is a short walk away. The walk back up is a bit of a lung buster so take it slowly! The cottage is well equipped and cosy. We highly recommend a visit!"_
